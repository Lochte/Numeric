Hello!

The task #23 is chosen

This task is a development of the integrator in the course tasks which can be found in the folder 8_adaptiveintegration.
In this task i was told to implement an adaptive integrator which employs Clenshaw-Curtis variable substitution algorithm. Furthermore i should check whether it is more effective than my ordinary adaptive integrator.

This is an overview of the content in the files:

counter.py
  - a simple counter, which tells how many times the adaptive integrator has been called.

integrator.py
  - The actual python code behind the adaptive integrator. Comments has been added where the Clenshaw Curtis algorithm has been added.

mainExam.py
  - simple script which defines the integrals calculated in this task, as well as the strings printed to the terminal.

outputExam.txt
  - The output to the terminal is saved in outputExam.txt in order to read the terminal output from a browser.

makefile
  - runs the project and option of cleaning the folder.
